# Workout Tracker

A relatively basic Workout Program Creator website, made using HTML, CSS, JS.
This website records each workout that you do on each day of the week, within those workouts you can set which excercises you do and the designated weight, reptitions and number of sets for each excercise
 
This project acts as an introduction to learning Web Development using HTML, CSS and JS
